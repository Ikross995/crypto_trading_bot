Added development setup and contribution guidelines

üíî Breaking Changes

Configuration Changes:





Environment variable names have been standardized (see migration guide)



Some configuration validation is now stricter



CLI argument format has changed (now uses typer-style commands)

API Changes:





Old function names have been deprecated (backward compatibility maintained)



Import paths have changed due to modular structure



Some internal APIs are no longer public

üìã Migration Guide

For Existing Users:





Update Environment Variables:





Copy .env.example to .env



Migrate your old variables (mostly compatible)



Check new validation rules in documentation



Update CLI Usage:

# Old
python bot.py --mode live --symbols BTCUSDT

# New  
python cli.py live --symbols BTCUSDT




Code Integration:





Update import paths if using bot as library



Check new API interfaces in core modules



Run tests to verify compatibility

Automated Migration:





Most configurations will work with minimal changes



The bot will provide helpful error messages for migration issues



Backup your .env file before updating

üîÆ Coming Soon (v2.1.0)





Complete data/ module with indicators and feature engineering



Full models/ module for LSTM and GPT integration



Enhanced strategy/ module with advanced signal generation



runner/ module for execution engines (live/paper/backtest)



infra/ module with logging, persistence, and metrics



Integration tests and end-to-end testing



Performance benchmarking and optimization



Web dashboard for monitoring and control
